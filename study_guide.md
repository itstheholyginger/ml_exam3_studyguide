# Machine Learning Exam 3 Study Guide

## Logistic Regression

### Classification
- Discrete and supervised
- Good for when dependent variable is binary (yes/no, red/blue, etc)
- Determines probability of the binary classification (y val of sigma curve)

### *Loss Function
- "Cost function"

### Compare with Linear Regression
- logistic regression predicts whether something is true or false, while linear regression predicts something of continuous size
- Linear fits a straight line, while logistic fits an "S" shaped logistic curve
- Logistic curve shows likelihood of discrete classifications
